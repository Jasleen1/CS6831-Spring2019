We have seen two main asymmetric primitives in the last lectures - RSA and Discrete Log Problem. In RSA problem, we work in ${Z_N}^*$ where $N=pq$ and p,q are prime numbers. The main assumption is that given N and it's factor p and q, we can have a pair of public key e and secret key d such that $X^e \mod N$ doesn't reveal any information about d. The Discrete Log Problem works in ${Z_p}^*$ for a prime P and the assumption is given $g^x \mod p$, where g is a generator, we can't recover x. In both of the above primitives, we need to increase the group size considerably to provide a better security guarantee. eg to provide 256-bit security, the group size needs to be a 15360-bit size for both RSA and DLP. The increase in group size leads to an increase in bandwidth, storage and computational time. This lead to the development of cryptographic primitives based on the Elliptic Curve, which had group size just twice larger than the security parameter. Elliptic Curve is now the state of the art practice, given that RSA and Discrete Log Problem have become slower and slower over the years.

Elliptic Curves are a discrete log-based system. They use a new kind of group defined relative to a finite field. Finite fields have two operations and everything has an inverse under both operations. An example of a finite field group is integer modulo p which is denoted by $F_p$ or $GF(p)$. Elliptic Curves will use curves over $F_p$.  

\newtheorem{df}{Definition}
\begin{df}
Elliptic Curves are defined as by the set of x,y points in $F_p$ defined by the equation 
\bnm
E={(x,y) \mid y^2 = x^3+ax+b\mod p}
\enm 
where a,b are fixed values also from $F_p$, plus one special point called Point of Infinity $\cal O$
\end{df}

It is also required $E$ to be non-singular. In other words,
the partial derivatives shouldn't vanish simultaneously for any point
on $E$. This is equivalent to requiring that the
equation $x^{3}+Ax+B=0$ has no multiple roots. Thus, solving the above condition leads to the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
 E is non singular if and only if $4A^{3} + 27B^{2}$ is not equal to zero
\end{lemma}

The \figref{fig:plot} shows the Elliptic Curve plot for the curve with A = -5 and B = 5. The graph is symmetric over the x-axis. It should be noted that the graph consists of real points, on the other hand, finite fields consist of some integer points on this graph. For example points (1,1) and (1,-1) on this graph are points of this curve in $F_5$.

\subsection{Elliptic Curve Group Operation.} A Group is a set G along with a binary operation associated with this group. This operation should have a certain set of properties. It should be closed and associative. Also, the group must contain an identity element and also have an inverse within the group for each element. The groups don't necessarily need to follow commutative property. The groups that follow commutative property are called abelian groups

All the points on an elliptic curve form an abelian group. We assume that every vertical line passes through a point called neutral element or point of infinity $ \cal O$ as shown in the \figref{fig:oper}. Inverse element of a point P, $P^{-1}$ is the point of intersection of the vertical line through P and the curve as seen in \figref{fig:oper}. The group operation for Elliptical Curve is called Point Addition and denoted by $P+Q$, where P and Q are points on the curve. Let $\diamond$ operator on points P and Q on the curve represent the intersection point of the line joining P and Q and the curve. Then the point addition can be represented as $\cal O \diamond (P \diamond Q)$. In other words, it represents the intersection of the vertical line through $P \diamond Q$ and the curve depicted in \figref{fig:oper}. The doubling of P, i.e P+P, is represented by similarly by taking the intersection of the tangent at P and the curve and drawing a vertical line through that point to get its intersection with the curve as shown in figure \figref{fig:oper}.

\paragraph{Algebraic Representation.} We can also represent the group operation algebraically for finite fields. The slope for the line between point P(x1,y1) and Q(x2,y2) is $D = \frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1} \mod p$. Thus the equation for the line will be  $y = D(x-x1) + y1 \mod p$. To find the intersection of the line with the curve, we will substitute the value of y to get ${(D(x-x1) + y1)}^2 = x^3 + ax + b \mod p$. The solution of this equation are x1 , x2 and $x3 = D^2-x1-x2 \mod p$, which gives $y3 = D(x3-x1) + y1 \mod p$. The pseudo code to get the Point Addition between two points P and Q is discussed in Algorithm \ref{algo}. The pseudo code also handles the corner cases where the P or Q is $\cal O$, then the result will be the other point as $P+\cal O = P$. In case the points are symmetric, the point addition will return $\cal O$ as $P + P^{-1}=\cal O $. Finally in case of point doubling, the slope with be the slope of the tangent at that point.

Interestingly, the point addition is an abelian group operation as it satisfies all four properties for group operation plus commutative property.
\begin{itemize}
\item Closure Property. P+Q lies on the curve for all P and Q, as discussed earlier.
\item Associative Property. (P+Q)+R = P+(Q+R)
\item Inverse Property. $P + P^{-1} = \cal O $ where $P^{-1} = (-x,y)$ for P=(x,y). Also ${\cal O}^{-1} = \cal O$. Since line passing through P and $P^{-1}$ is a vertical line, it passes through $\cal O$.
\item Identity Property. P+$\cal O$ = P, as the vertical line intersects the inverse point $P^{-1}$, and vertical line through $P^{-1}$ intersect $P$. Thus the point of infinity is an identity for the group.
\item Commutative Property. P+Q = Q +P, as the line passing through P and Q, will be the same in both cases.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Scalar Multiplication.} Scalar multiplication $nP$ is equivalent to adding P to itself n times. This is analogous to exponentiation in $Z_p$ and can be computed by point double and add algorithm similar to square and multiply in case of integers. We can also pick generator P that defines a cyclic subgroup of E such that $0P, 1P, 2P, 3P \dots qP$ all lies on the curve. 

\paragraph{Building Elliptic Curve Groups.} Earlier people used to find suitable curves by a deterministic algorithm that picks a large prime p and random a and b to define a curve. Then we can determine the size of the group in polynomial time using Schoof algorithm. The size of the group should be large and prime for security reasons. Finally, pick a point P on the curve to be a generator. This process was very slow. Recently, these curves and generator point P have been standardized instead. Some examples of such curves are NIST curves, Curve25519.
